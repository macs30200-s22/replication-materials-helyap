# How does subjective social class affect mobilizatoin of parental aid in the job search process?

# Exploratory findings:
## Results from logistic regression - mobilization of mother

## Results from logistic regression - mobilization of father

## Significance of intial findings:
Firstly, the main predictor variables of interest (social class, tie strength, network size) were not able to predict the mobilization of the father in the job search process in logistic regression. However, the father's social class was statistically significant in predicting the mobilization of the mother when accounting for the predictor variables of interest and also controlling for race and gender of the respondent. Due to the small sample size, additional review is necessary to see if the results replicate (the sample was also non-representative with 0 self-reported identities of Hispanic/Latino ethinicity).
